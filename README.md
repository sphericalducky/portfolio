# Shreya Sharma - Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio! I'm a passionate advocate and researcher dedicated to combating the prescription medication crisis through community education, youth leadership, and direct intervention.

## About Me

I am a dedicated youth advocate with over five years of experience working with the National Coalition for Prescription Drug Abuse (NCAPDA). My work focuses on preventing overdoses, educating communities about prescription drug risks, and implementing life-saving programs at the school, local, and state level. Through leadership, research, and direct community engagement, I've helped reach thousands of individuals with critical prevention education and resources.

## Featured Work: Prescription Medication Crisis & Community Impact

### The Problem: Understanding the Crisis

The prescription medication crisis in the U.S. began in the 1990s with the overprescription of opioids, expanding to include widespread misuse of various prescription drugs.

#### Origins of the Epidemic

- **The Sackler Family**: Profited billions while downplaying addiction risks; faced $7.4 billion settlement in 2025
- **Consequences**: Widespread dependency leading patients to turn to heroin and synthetic opioids like fentanyl when prescriptions became unavailable

#### Impact by the Numbers
- **National**: ~107,000 drug overdose deaths in 2023, with ~80,000 involving opioids
- **California**: 11,359 overdose deaths in 2023, primarily driven by synthetic opioids
